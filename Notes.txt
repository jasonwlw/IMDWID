(done) Fix data association; should be in IMDWID Directory

(done) Add tqdm progress bar to combine_channels.py; clean up combine_channels.py

Add imgaug to requirements file; issue with loading module after installing requirements

Either add IPython installation (mrcnn/visualize) or keep code commented out

Installed cudNN 7.6; Cuda 10.0.0

2226 is aug? Look for latest timestamp

TODO:

(done) Add D-RISE

Test D-RISE

Enable prediction saliency maps

use DRISECallback to create saliency maps, save to data/drise_maps directory with same image name. Load them in load_image_gt in lieu of augmentation

Use difference in bext prediction (according to what metrics?) and target saliency maps; target - prediction and normalize to emphasize areas the mode didn't focus on and deemphasize parts it did

(done) Add conv1 to training!

Image type bool warning??

(done) Training not returning any bounding boxes; check inference; masks were being transposed; forgot to remove line when combine_channels wasn't refined

Add removing data and rgbd-dataset.csv to combine_channels script

Test no augmentation model and augmentation on augmented images
