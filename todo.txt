Get D-RISE script into repository

Train Mask R-CNN on RGB+D Images; make sure to record training parameters

Compare RGB+D to RGB to D (alone) images; RGB and D serve as baseline

Apply D-RISE to RGB+D, RGB, and D predictions; compute average saliency maps per class, perform "smart augmentation"

Is there a way to automate "smart augmentation"? i.e., take cropping of target box even when prediction was missed? These could be passed back to model for more training
